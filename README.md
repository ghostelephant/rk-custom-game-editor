# Graphical Editor for Riskrieg Games

## Create JSONS

Use this editor to create game save JSONs with players and territories pre-filled in. Useful for creating games that have special circumstances (e.g. pre-assigned territories, multiple capitals).

### Couldn't I just manually edit the JSON?

Yeah, that also works, but it's easier to do it here because

- It's a bit easier to see what you're doing, especially with the colors
- It gives you some error-catching that manually creating a JSON doesn't (e.g. it catches if you assign the same territory to multiple players)
- It's all case-insensitive so that's nice

### Code stuff or whatever
